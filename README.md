# JavaScript Null Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to null value handling during addition. The `foo` function attempts to gracefully handle null values as inputs by returning 0 if either `a` or `b` is null. However, this approach might not always be the desired or most robust solution, as other parts of the application may not expect 0 to be returned as a result of null inputs.  This example illustrates the importance of careful consideration of how null values are handled throughout a JavaScript application to avoid unexpected errors.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in the assumption that a null value will never need to be handled as an integral value.  While this works in the specific example, more complex interactions could lead to unforeseen behaviors.

## Solution

The proposed solution clarifies the behavior by either throwing an error or by explicitly coercing `null` values to 0 before the addition.
